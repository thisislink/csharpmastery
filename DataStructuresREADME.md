## Running the Projects

1. Clone the [csharpmastery](https://github.com/thisislink/csharpmastery.git) repository
2. Open the DataStructures directory and the project solution (.sln) file you would like to demo in Visual Studio. An example .sln file would be HelloDaphne.sln that is found in the HelloDaphne directory.
3. In Visual Studio, run the application by doing one of the following options:

   - Press the F5 key on your keyboard
   - Click the green play button on the toolbar next to the name of the project HelloDaphne

4. The console window will launch and display output on the screen.

### Project 1 - Stacks

This is a console app that lets a user create a stack of books, add books to the stack, remove books from the stack, and display the stack of books.

<ins>Technical decisions</ins>

App uses the generic Stack class and its pre-defined methods (push, pop, and peek) to introduce the concept and usage of stacks.

Also implemented a custom display method to show the list of books.

### Project 2 - Queues

This is a console app that lets a user start a line for waiting to represent a queue. You can add people to the end of the line, remove from the front of the line, see who is the first person in line, and display the names of people in the line.

<ins>Technical decisions</ins>

App uses the generic Queue class and its pre-defined methods (enqueue, dequeue, and peek) to introduce the concept and usage of stacks.

Also implemented a custom display method to show the people waiting in line and the count of people in line.
