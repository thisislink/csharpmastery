4. The console window will launch and display output on the screen.

### Project 1 - Stacks

This is a console app that lets a user create a stack of books, add books to the stack, remove books from the stack, and display the stack of books.

<ins>Technical decisions</ins>
App uses the generic Stack class and its pre-defined methods (push, pop, and peek) to introduce the concept and usage of stacks.

Also implemented a custom display method to show the list of books.
